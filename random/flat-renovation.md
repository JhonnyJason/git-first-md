# Flat Renovation

When buying a low cost old flat, the water pressure might be annoyingly low.
Also it might not be a good Idea to try to convince the house Community to give higher pressure to the whole building, as the old pipes might break.

For the own flat one could buy a [water pressure booster pump](https://www.wasserpumpe.de/tallas-d-eboost-850-hauswasserautomat) and renew all pipes inside the flat anyways. Combine it with an additional filter system if desired.
