# Our Void PWAs
We fully commit onto the development of Progressive Web Apps(PWA). Therein we have some important principles in mind which not only gives us a mission to achieve, but also gives the user complete autonomy.

## Principle: Freedom
Websites/WebApps as Information/Tools - should be [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

- Selfhostable
- Modifiable
- SourceCode Availability 
- SourceCode Simplicity

## Principle: User Owned Data
Websites/WebApps as Information/Tools - should keep the User in Full Charge of their Data.

- No Tracking
- No Leaks

## Principle: No Disctraction
Websites/WebApps as Information/Tools - should have their Interface crafted soley for their intended use/purpose.

- No Advertisement

## Principle: No Free Trials
Websites/WebApps as Information/Tools - should keep their features over time.

- No time-limited premium access then blackmail for keeping the best features

## Principle: Charity-Balance
Websites/WebApps as Information/Tools - should intend to provide most unconditional value to its users, however it should be in a sustainable way.

- Hosting of Websites/WebApps and their supportive Services costs money and effort
- There should be reasonable profitability aside of charity 
- Transparency about profitability design and its charity-balance

E.g. wikipedia failed in this and this seems made it more vulnerable to some problems down the line.
