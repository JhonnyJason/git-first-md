# Setup of the Void Mailbox

As we used the free mailhosting service by [Gandi](https://gandi.net) to offer cheap webhosting + email addresses to our customers we soon got another reminder to never rely on external free services to offer competetive prices in the webhosting business.

Since about summer 2023 Gandi stopped their offer to include 2 free mailboxes on every domain. And we were confronted with the decision to either demand + ~3-5€ / per mailbox per month from customers used to paying as little as 6€ per month for our standard webhosting  + email service - or set up and maintain our own email service.

This is because using a paid service for hosting custom domains mailboxes all cost more than 3€/m - or at least the choosable options like [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/).

## The Non-Economical Decision
Regarding the economics of the decision it would be better to notify the customers that we need to increase prices substantially. Mainly because there is a low likelyhood of customers moving away - our sellingpoint is not the cheap hosting, it is our [Development Services](https://dotv.ee/#services) which tends to require hosting as well.

Increasing the prices, and just stay on Gandi the most economical solution - total spent manhours < 0.5.
Comparing to the unknown amount of manhours of setting up an enterprise-ready mailserver an unsophisticated estimate would be 180 manhours. So the real number could easily be 540 (applying the estimation x3 rule). Plus the unknown amount of yearly maintenance work. Estimate is 2 so maybe 6 manhours.

But we decided on maintaining our own mailserver anyways.

- Because we go the hard path.
- Because we work towards a vision where this is a part of our server-landscape.
- Because we already have some experience hosting our modified [mail-in-a-box](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox).

## Documentations
At the same time we may provice a full documentation for specific parts, which could help you in your setup as well.

Because we share the core values of the ["redecentralization of the web"](https://redecentralize.org/). 

- Setup Documentation [here](TODO:)
